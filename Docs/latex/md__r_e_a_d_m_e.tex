This repository contains the result of my personal work for the final Assignment of the course.

The goal of this assignment is to Develop a software architecture for the control of the robot in the environment. The software relies on the move\+\_\+base and gmapping packages for localizing the robot and plan the motion. The architecture should be able to get the user request, and let the robot execute one of the following behaviors (depending on the userâ€™s input)\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item autonomously reach a x,y coordinate inserted by the user.
\item let the user drive the robot with the keyboard
\item let the user drive the robot assisting them to avoid collisions
\item autonomously cancel a goal if it is not reachable using a timeout
\item in addition we could add the functionality of manually canceling a given goal
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To do this we had to use R\+OS for controlling the robot and Gazebo and R\+Viz environments. I decided to use C++ as programming language.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{Table of contents}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}

This repository Contains all the useful files to run the scripts that i produced for this assignment. To try it, it is sufficient to clone this repository in your R\+OS workspace\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/claudio-\/dg/final\_assignment.git}
\end{DoxyCode}


and then type the following command in the terminal to simultaneously launch all the necessary nodes through the $\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}launch\+File\char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ roslaunch final\_assignment final.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


This Launch File has been made to make it easier to run the project , but if you like you can manually run every part of the project by launching the following launch files\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ roslaunch final\_assignment move\_base.launch}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ roslaunch final\_assignment simulation\_gmapping.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


To run the simulation environment and the move\+\_\+base functions.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ roslaunch final\_assignment teleop.launch}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ roslaunch final\_assignment my\_scripts.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


To run the teleop\+\_\+\+Twist\+\_\+keyboard node and my scripts produced for this assignment.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Gazebo and Rviz Maps}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
The environment used for this assignment consists in the map illustrated (froma Gazebo view) in the following image\+:

 

Rviz instead gives another point of view of the same environment, that is from robot sensors\textquotesingle{} point of view\+: the robot, in fact, does not know from the beginning the full map he\textquotesingle{}s in, but thanks to the laser sensors and the {\ttfamily gmapping} package he is capable of creating it.

 \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Project structure and behaviour description}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
The project is based on the R\+OS scheme that is shown in the following graph\+:

 

The R\+OS package of the project is called {\ttfamily \char`\"{}final\+\_\+assignment\char`\"{}}, it exploits two already given packages\+: {\ttfamily slam\+\_\+gmapping}, which opens the environment and allows the robot to create a map of what sorrounds him, and {\ttfamily move\+\_\+base}, which requires a goal to be sent to the topic {\ttfamily move\+\_\+base/goal} in order to make the robot move towards it.

In addition to these i created two nodes contained in {\ttfamily src} folder named {\ttfamily Input\+Console} and {\ttfamily controller}; as the name suggests the first one is encharged of taking user\textquotesingle{}s inputs to select the desired behaviour of the robot, while the second one manages the consequences of user\textquotesingle{}s request by communicating with other nodes, for instance by sending the goal\textquotesingle{}s coordinates to {\ttfamily move\+\_\+base/goal} with a msg of type \+:{\ttfamily move\+\_\+base\+\_\+msgs/\+Move\+Base\+Action\+Goal}. The communication between my two nodes is implemented through a {\ttfamily Publish/\+Subscribe} architecture using two different topics {\ttfamily M\+Y\+\_\+topic\+\_\+teleop} \& {\ttfamily M\+Y\+\_\+topic\+\_\+send\+\_\+goal}\+: in this way I made a structure in which the input given by the user determines which callback is going to be called in the controller node, so that the \char`\"{}async structure\char`\"{} required by this assignment was possible.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Regarding point 1) I used the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}move\+\_\+base\textbackslash{}feedback} topic to retreive information about robot\textquotesingle{}s status such as the current position or the time counter\+: thanks to these two pieces of information I implemented an algorithm to state whether the goal was reached or not (considering an approximation error due to the fact that the robot seemed to get really close to the goal but never reaching its exact coordinates), and a T\+I\+M\+E\+O\+UT, so that if the robot doesen\textquotesingle{}t reach the goal in Time it is considered unreachable and will be canceled by sending a msg to {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}move\+\_\+base\textbackslash{}cancel} topic
\item Regarding points 2) and 3) of the assignment I remapped an already existing topic ({\ttfamily teleop\+\_\+twist\+\_\+keyboard}) so that instead of publishing directly on {\ttfamily cmd\+\_\+vel} it publishes on my personal topic {\ttfamily my\+Remapped\+\_\+cmd\+\_\+vel}\+: by doing this I manage to consider the velocities published by this topic only when required, that is when the user selected mode 2) or 3), furthermore it allowed me to add the collision avoidance functionality needed for the third part of the assignment.

After having launched all the required launch files Gazebo and Rviz environments will open, along with 3 different terminals\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input Console} \+: in which you can select what to do and that will show the following user interface\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{***********THIS IS THE INPUT CONSOLE***********}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Which Action do you want to use to move the robot?}
\DoxyCodeLine{ENTER 'c' to cancel last given goal}
\DoxyCodeLine{ENTER '1' to send a new goal to the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{ENTER '2  to manually drive the robot}
\DoxyCodeLine{ENTER '3' to manually drive the robot WITH assisted collision avoidance}
\DoxyCodeLine{ENTER 'q' to terminate this node}
\end{DoxyCode}

\item {\ttfamily Controller Console} \+: that will show some useful real-\/time info depending on the modality selected in the input console, such as the elapsed time since the goal was given or some notifications to inform the user tha a certain direction will probably cause a collision.
\item {\ttfamily Teleop\+Twist Keyboard Console} \+: in which the user can insert commands to manually drive the robot that will only be read if modality 2) or 3) were previously selected through the input console.
